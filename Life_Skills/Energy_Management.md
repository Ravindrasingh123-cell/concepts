# Energy Management 

## 1. Manage Energy, Not Just Time

We always hear about managing time, but what actually matters more is **managing energy**.  
There are 4 emotional zones:

- **Excitement**
- **Stress**
- **Depression**
- **Calm**

The idea is to mostly stay in Excitement, Stress (for short bursts), and Calm.  
Too much Stress → burnout. Too much Calm → comfort zone. Depression → avoid.  
The real growth happens when we move between **Stress → Calm → Excitement**.

A helpful idea:  
**Feel the stress → complete the task → move to calm activities to recover**.
