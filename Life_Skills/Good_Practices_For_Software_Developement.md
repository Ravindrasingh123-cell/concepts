# Good Practices for Software Development

---

## 1. Gathering Requirements

- I’ve learned it's super important to take proper notes when discussing project requirements with the team.
- If anything is unclear, it’s best to ask during the meeting itself — because it’s often hard to get everyone back together later.
- Tools like Trello or Jira are helpful for keeping track of everything, but even if your team doesn’t use them, writing down and sharing the requirements can avoid confusion later.
- Sometimes requirements stay a bit vague, no matter what. In those cases, getting regular feedback while working really helps to stay aligned with the team.

## 2. Always Over-Communicate

- If requirements change or something unexpected comes up, it’s better to inform the team right away.
- Things like no internet, laptop issues, or delays in the task — all should be shared with the team.
- It’s good to post updates in team channels (like Slack) instead of private DMs, so everyone stays in the loop.
- Also, if I miss a call, I should respond and let the person know I’ll call back soon — better than just ignoring it.
- Keeping the camera on during meetings helps build connection and improve communication.

## 3. Stuck? Ask the Right Questions

- Just saying "it’s not working" is not helpful.
- I’ve learned that I need to clearly explain what the problem is, and also mention what I’ve already tried to fix it.
- Sharing screenshots, screen recordings (like with [Loom](https://www.loom.com)), or code snippets using [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) really helps others understand faster.
- Tools like [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) and [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) are great for sharing entire working setups.

## 4. Get to Know Your Teammates

- It’s not just about code — knowing the team I work with really makes a difference.
- Joining meetings a few minutes early gives a chance to chat casually and build better connections.
- It’s also helpful to know others' working hours so that meetings or calls are scheduled at a good time.

## 5. Be Mindful of Others

- Everyone is busy with their own work, so I try not to spam messages.
- If I have multiple questions, it’s better to write them all in one message instead of sending five separate ones.
- Also, if someone replies to me, I try to stay available so we can sort things out quickly instead of going back and forth for hours.
- Picking the right communication method depending on the urgency is also something I keep in mind.

## 6. Give 100% Involvement

- Remote work still needs full focus.
- Programming requires deep thinking, so staying away from distractions is really important.
- I’m trying to follow the idea of “Work when you work, play when you play.”
- I keep my phone on silent and only allow work-related notifications during work hours.
- I’m also using tools like:
  - [TimeLimit](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/timelimit/id1493993396) or 
  - [Freedom](https://freedom.to/)  
  to block social media during work.
- [Boosted](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simplyproductivity.boosted) is a good app I’ve tried for tracking how I spend time.
- Eating properly and doing some exercise daily helps me stay active and focused.

## Review Questions

### 1. Which point(s) were new to you?

I never really thought deeply about how important it is to **clearly explain problems when asking for help**.  
Also, the idea of using screencasts and sharing code through Gist or CodeSandbox is something I hadn’t used before — and it makes a lot of sense.

---

### 2. Which area do you think you need to improve on?  
What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

I think I need to improve on **being more consistent with focus and managing distractions**.  
Sometimes I pick up the phone or check social media without realising it’s breaking my flow.  
I plan to start using Freedom or TimeLimit to block those apps and also try to follow proper work/break cycles — like Pomodoro — to stay sharp throughout the day.
