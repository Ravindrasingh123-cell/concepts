Question 1: What is the Feynman Technique?
It’s a way of learning by explaining the concept in your own simple words, as if you're teaching it to someone else.

Question 2: What was the most interesting story or idea for you?

One of the most interesting ideas was how Barbara struggled with math early on, but later became an engineer by changing how she approached learning — showing that anyone can learn tough subjects with the right strategies.

Question 3: What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

- Active mode is when you're fully focused, like solving a math problem or writing code.

- Diffused mode is a relaxed state when your brain makes connections in the background — like when you get ideas while walking or showering.

Question 4: What are the steps to take when approaching a new topic?

- Break the skill down into smaller parts

- Learn just enough to self-correct

- Remove distractions

- Practice at least 20 hours

- Learning Principles in the Bootcamp

- Give your full attention while learning or coding — 100% involvement matters.

- Programming is not just about writing code; it’s about focused and sustained thinking.

- Train your brain to stay focused — attention is a skill that improves with practice.

- Read Deep Work to understand how deep focus leads to quality output.

- Follow the rule: “Work when you work, play when you play.”

- Silence your phone, turn off non-work notifications, and block distracting apps or sites.

- Use tools like Boosted to track how you spend your time and boost productivity.

## How to Learn Software Concepts

- Where is this used in real life? Try to understand how the concept is actually applied.

- What does it really mean? See if you can explain it in your own words.

- How can I use it? Try writing code or designing something with that concept.

- What’s my deadline? Set a timeline to finish your practice or project so you don’t fall behind.

### Tips:

- Deadlines are just there to help you plan — what really matters is actually understanding the topic.

- Stay curious and try to enjoy learning instead of stressing over it.

- Learn in a way that makes sense to you — use your own words and your own style.

- Try teaching what you’ve learned to someone else — that’s how you know you really get it.

- You don’t have to learn everything — just focus on getting really good at a few important things.

### How Are Trainees Evaluated?

- Can you explain what you’ve learned in a simple and clear way, whether you're talking or writing?

- Can you use the concept properly in your code and make it work well?

- Are you able to stay focused and finish your work within the given time?

- Do you speak up early when you’re stuck or facing any issues?

- Do you share your thoughts clearly without adding too much unnecessary stuff?

## Question 5: What actions can you take to improve your learning?

- Try to explain what you’ve learned in simple words, like you're teaching a friend.

- Don’t just sit and code nonstop — take short breaks or go for a walk to help your mind relax.

- Instead of trying to learn everything at once, break it into small parts and practice a little every day.

- Make sure your study or work space is quiet and free from distractions.

- Keep track of how you're spending your time and think about what’s helping you learn better.

- Don’t be afraid to ask questions. Try helping others or build something using what you’ve learned — it really helps you understand things better.
