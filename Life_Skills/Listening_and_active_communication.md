# Listening and Communication – My Notes and Reflection
## 1. Introduction

Good communication isn’t just about talking. It’s also about listening carefully and responding the right way. I’ve recently been learning about different ways of listening, like active and reflective listening, and also different styles of communication like passive, aggressive, and assertive. In this write-up, I’m sharing what I’ve understood from the videos and readings, along with my personal reflections.

## 2. Active Listening
### What is Active Listening?

Active listening means fully focusing on the speaker, understanding what they’re saying, and showing them that you're actually listening. It helps build better understanding and reduces confusion or conflict.

### 6 Strategies for Active Listening (From the Video)

- Give full attention – No distractions like phones or looking around.

- Show you're listening – Nodding, eye contact, and reacting naturally.

- Don't interrupt – Let the person finish before you speak.

- Ask questions – Especially if something is unclear.

- Summarize or repeat – To confirm what the person meant.

- Respond properly – Be respectful and relevant when replying.

## 3. Reflective Listening
### What is Reflective Listening?

Reflective listening is a more detailed version of active listening. It’s about really getting the speaker’s feelings and repeating back what they said in your own words. This way, both sides are sure they understand each other.

### Key Points from Fisher’s Model

- Listen with empathy – Feel what the other person is feeling.

- Reflect back – Repeat the message in your own words.

- Mirror emotions and body language – So the speaker knows you get them.

- Confirm understanding – Ask if what you understood is correct.

- Don’t just listen to words – Also notice the tone and feelings.

- Make sure both people are on the same page.

## 4. Reflection on My Own Listening Skills
### What are the obstacles in your listening process?

Some things that stop me from listening well are:

- Getting distracted (especially by my phone).

- Thinking about my reply while the other person is still talking.

- Interrupting without realizing.

- Daydreaming or zoning out during long talks.

- Assuming I already know what they’re going to say.

### What can you do to improve your listening?

To be a better listener, I can:

- Put my phone away when someone is talking.

- Let them finish before I respond.

- Make eye contact and nod so they know I’m listening.

- Ask questions when something is not clear.

- Summarize what I heard to check I got it right.

## 5. Types of Communication
### Different Styles of Communication

#### There are 4 main styles:

- Passive – Not speaking up or expressing what you really feel.

- Aggressive – Speaking in a loud, forceful, or disrespectful way.

- Passive-Aggressive – Not being direct; using sarcasm, giving silent treatment, or gossiping.

- Assertive – Clearly and respectfully saying what you think or feel.

## 6. Personal Reflection on My Communication Styles
### When do you switch to Passive communication style?

#### I act passive when:

- I don’t want to cause conflict or drama.

- I feel nervous or unsure of myself.

- The other person is more dominant or confident.

### When do you switch to Aggressive communication style?

#### I get aggressive when:

- I’m super stressed or frustrated.

- I feel like no one is listening to me.

- I’m defending something I strongly believe in.

### When do you switch to Passive-Aggressive communication style?

- I notice this happens when:

- I feel upset but don’t want to say it directly.

- I use sarcasm or jokes to hide what I really mean.

- I give silent treatment instead of talking things out.

## 7. How Can I Be More Assertive?

After watching the videos, I learned that being assertive is the best communication style. It helps me say what I feel without hurting others.

### Steps I Can Take to Be More Assertive:

- Use "I" statements like “I feel…” or “I need…” instead of blaming.

- Keep calm and steady tone, even during tense moments.

- Be honest but kind – speak my truth without being rude.

- Prepare for tough conversations instead of avoiding them.

- Practice active listening before I respond.

- Stand up for myself but also respect others' opinions.

## 8. Application in Work/Tech Context

### In business or tech meetings:

- I should take notes and double-check them with the team or clients.

- During technical talks, I’ll paraphrase key points to confirm.

- Use reflective listening to ensure nothing is misunderstood.

- Stay assertive while giving feedback or sharing ideas.

- Make sure everyone is on the same page, especially when small details matter.

## 9. Conclusion

Learning about listening and communication has helped me understand how I can become better at handling conversations. Whether it’s at work, with friends, or family – being an active and reflective listener, and using assertive communication, can make a big difference. It helps avoid conflicts, builds trust, and makes sure everyone feels heard and respected.
