# Understanding and Applying Tiny Habits and Atomic Habits

## 1. Tiny Habits – BJ Fogg (Video 1)

### Question 1: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting idea for me in this video was how BJ Fogg explained that we don’t need motivation to start a habit. He told a story about how he started flossing his teeth by doing just one tooth at a time. This seemed silly at first, but it worked because it was so easy that he had no excuse not to do it. Over time, it naturally grew into a full habit. What stood out was the idea that starting small removes the pressure, and it’s okay to start tiny. The important thing is consistency.

### Question 2: How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?

B = MAP stands for Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt. This formula explains that for any behavior to happen, you need these three things:

- M (Motivation): Your desire to do the habit.

- A (Ability): How easy it is to do the habit.

- P (Prompt): A trigger or reminder to do the habit.

To make a new habit easier, you can increase ability (make it simpler), reduce reliance on motivation (since motivation goes up and down), and make sure there is a clear prompt. For example, if I want to start drinking water in the morning, I can place a glass next to my bed (prompt), make it easy by filling it the night before (ability), and not rely on motivation.

### Question 3: Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?

Celebrating is a powerful way to teach your brain that what you just did is good. When you say “Yes!” or smile or do a fist pump after doing your tiny habit, your brain releases positive chemicals like dopamine. BJ Fogg calls this “Shine.” This emotion wires the habit into your brain faster and makes it something you want to repeat. Without celebration, habits may not stick, even if you repeat them. It’s not just about action; it’s about how you feel afterward.

### Question 4: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting idea for me was the concept of compounding improvement—getting 1% better every day. It doesn’t feel like much at first, but over time it leads to massive growth. The speaker used examples like improving your fitness or learning a skill. The key message was that success doesn't come from big changes all at once. Instead, it’s the result of small, consistent improvements that add up. This made me realize that I don’t have to be perfect, just better than yesterday.

### Question 5: What is the book’s perspective about Identity?

The book teaches that the most powerful way to build a habit is to focus on who you want to become, not just what you want to achieve. For example, instead of saying “I want to read more,” say “I am a reader.” When your habits align with your identity, you’re more likely to stick to them. Every time you do the habit, you are proving to yourself that you are that kind of person. Identity-based habits are more sustainable because they are part of who you are.

### Question 6: Write about the book’s perspective on how to make a habit easier to do.

To make a habit easier to do, the book recommends reducing friction. This means removing obstacles and making the habit as convenient as possible. For example, if you want to work out, lay your gym clothes out the night before. If you want to eat healthy, put fruits on the counter and hide junk food. The easier it is to start, the more likely you are to follow through. The goal is to make the habit so easy you can’t say no.

### Question 7: Write about the book’s perspective on how to make a habit harder to do.

To stop a bad habit, you need to increase friction. This means making the habit more difficult or less accessible. For example, if you want to watch less TV, unplug it or remove the remote batteries. If you want to check your phone less, delete social media apps or keep your phone in another room. The harder it is to do the behavior, the less likely you are to do it. Creating obstacles is a smart way to break bad habits.

## 5. Reflection

### Question 8: Pick one habit that you would like to do more of. What are the steps that you can take to make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and/or the response satisfying?

Habit I want to build: Reading for 10 minutes every day.

#### Steps:

- Cue: Keep a book on my pillow so I see it before bed.

- Attractive: Choose books I’m excited to read, like mystery or self-help.

- Easy: Only commit to reading one page. I can do more if I feel like it.

- Satisfying: Track each day I read on a habit tracker and celebrate mentally by saying “Nice job!” after I finish.

### Question 9: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of. What are the steps that you can take to make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

Habit I want to reduce: Mindless scrolling on Instagram.

#### Steps:

- Cue invisible: Delete the app from my phone or log out.

- Unattractive: Remind myself how I feel drained after scrolling for too long.

- Hard: Use a website blocker or set screen time limits.

- Unsatisfying: Reflect on how little value I got after scrolling. Replace the reward by doing something better like listening to music or walking.

## Conclusion

Building and breaking habits doesn’t need to be complicated. From BJ Fogg’s “Tiny Habits” to James Clear’s “Atomic Habits,” the message is the same: Start small, make it easy, and celebrate success. Whether it’s becoming 1% better every day or shaping your identity through habits, these strategies offer practical tools for real-life change. What matters most is consistency, not perfection.
